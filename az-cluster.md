# Azure Cluster

Rancher 2.x offers three possible ways to create a Kubernetes cluster on Azure:



- Managed Kubernetes (AKS)
- Rancher Node Driver
- Custom Nodes



I've posted an [article](https://rancher.com/blog/2020/build-kubernetes-clusters-on-azure) on the Rancher blog, on how to create a cluster using the Rancher node drivers and why that might be a good idea and more suitable for Enterprise IT than standalone AKS.



For all three options, you can find my plan files on GitHub: [AKS](https://github.com/chfrank-cgn/Rancher/tree/master/aks-cluster), [Node Driver](https://github.com/chfrank-cgn/Rancher/tree/master/az-cluster-1), [Custom Nodes](https://github.com/chfrank-cgn/Rancher/tree/master/az-cluster-2).



Happy Ranching!
